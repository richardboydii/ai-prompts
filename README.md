# ai-prompts

A repository containing AI prompts that I've been using for both vibe coding and to run my own AI experiments. Feel free to copy and extend these prompts for your own purposes.

## AI Prompts

- [Finance - Day Trading](finance/day-trading.md): An experiment that I'm running with $1000.00 in order to see if the AI can generate consistent returns on a monthly basis. I take recommendations at the beginning of the month then buy and hold until the end of the month.
- [Development - Python](development/python.md): A very basic set of rules and tasks for general Python development. I've been using this prompt for a lot of tasks at work lately.
- [Development - Typescript](development/typescript.md): This prompt is what I've been using in order to create some personal projects that are mostly SPAs.
